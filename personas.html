            <h1>Brown University Card Swipe Access Machine</h1>
            <h3>A look at interactions with everyday UI around Brown University</h3>
        <div id="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
            <div>
                <h4>User interface (UI) can be found examined even through some of the simplest objects around us. The goal was to focus on a particular example of UI around campus at Brown University, and practice observing & capturing everyday user interactions and their journey.</h4>
                <h2>The Interface</h2>
                <img
                    class="small-pic"
                    src="./assets/img/personas/sketch.png"
                    alt="swipe-machine-sketch"
                />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The standard card swipe access machine found all over
                        the public buildings at Brown University, including but
                        not limited to, dorms, libraries, and research
                        buildings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The hardware of the machine is simple, with a thin gap
                        on the right side of the machine affording the operation
                        of swiping one's card. Three lights (red, yellow, and
                        green respectively) run vertically along the gap, each
                        color signifying (but to a limited extent) one's access
                        to the building. Each of the three colors light up
                        (though the middle light is rarely ever on) to indicate
                        different levels of access: green indicates the card has
                        swiped successfully, whereas the red indicates that
                        access is not permitted.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Observations and User Input on Interactions</h2>
                <h3>Key Observations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Though the majority of buildings have the machine
                        positioned on the exterior of the building, which may
                        signal the need for swipe access, for public buildings
                        (i.e. libraries and campus buildings) many would ignore
                        the machine and reach for the door first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Swiping is a very straightforward process for the
                        majority of users, with most taking only one swipe for
                        most.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A good number of users swipe the card up and down
                        multiple times until the light turns green or they hear
                        an audible click from the door being unlocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the light turns red upon swiping, sometimes users
                        will flip their card over on the other side and try once
                        more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the unusual (but not uncommon) case where both the
                        red and green lights are on simultaneously, many users
                        will proceed to swipe their cards.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Key Questions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Step-by-step, how would you describe the typical process of
                    using the swipe access machine?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How would you describe your ideal experience of using the
                    swipe access machine?
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you were giving instructions to someone who has never
                    used this machine, how confident would you feel about
                    explaining the process?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is one aspect of your experience with the swipe access
                    machine that you wish were different?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>User Responses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Almost all of the users described the experience and overall
                    process as very intuitive, with the majority stating that
                    the experience consists of simply taking out one's card,
                    swiping multiple times in a vertical fashion in order to
                    make sure that the door unlocks, signaled either by the
                    visual flashing green light or the audible cue of the door
                    unlocking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users described the ideal experience to consist of no
                    hesitation on which side of the ID card would work, and
                    needing only a single swipe to unlock the door to expedite
                    the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interestingly, despite most agreeing that the overall
                    experience was easy, many expressed various difficulties
                    with the interface. Some complained about how each
                    individual machine took more vigorous swipes than others in
                    order to fully unlock, attributing this inconsistency to
                    different levels of wear and tear. Others expressed
                    lingering confusion in addition to frustration, despite a
                    lot of experience with the machine, with which side of the
                    ID card to swipe. Some expressed more clarity on this issue,
                    rather than having to waste extra seconds on
                    trial-and-error.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Further, many expressed confusion and wanted more clarity on
                    what each of the lights/combination of lights signified. For
                    instance, many users did not know what the middle (yellow)
                    light represented, given that it was rarely on. Similarly,
                    users weren't sure about what it meant when both the red and
                    green lights were on simultaneously, and many expressed that
                    just to be safe they take the extra step to swipe anyway in
                    case the door is locked.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Apathetic Andrew:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Apathetic Andrew is a full-time student at Brown
                        University, who doesn't think too deeply about the card
                        swipe access machine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He still, however, runs into minor inconveniences, such
                        as the need to swipe multiple times on the machine in
                        order to make sure that the door fully unlocks. Like
                        most busy students, Andrew doesn't think too much about
                        the workings of the machine, and would prefer that the
                        machine works with a single swipe, but doesn't care too
                        much that he has to spend the extra seconds swiping
                        repeatedly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Andrew represents the majority of students at Brown, who
                        understand the workings of the swipe access machine
                        intuitively, and don't think too much about how it could
                        be improved. Again, he does experience challenges at
                        times with the machine, such as the need to constantly
                        swipe more than once to confirm the door is unlocked,
                        but this has become a habit at this point and doesn't
                        believe that there is a dire need for improvements.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Impatient Izzy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Impatient Izzy is also a full-time student at Brown
                        University, though unlike Apathetic Andrew, finds even
                        the smallest of inconveniences regarding the swipe
                        access machine to be a nuisance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Izzy feels a dire need to go from place-to-place,
                        especially when it comes to getting inside her dorm once
                        she returns home from a late night at the library. She
                        finds the ever-so-often need to flip the ID card over an
                        unnecessary action, and finds herself comparing Brown's
                        swipe access system with that of other schools, which
                        employ 'tap-to-enter' technology.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I feel that Izzy represents not necessarily any one of
                        the users I've interviewed as a whole, but rather the
                        small parts within each of them that find the swipe
                        access machine a little inconvenient. At times, busy
                        college students can be in a rush to get from location
                        to location, and at times, issues with the swipe access
                        machine (such as that moment of hesitation when it's
                        unclear whether doors are unlocked because both red and
                        green lights are on at the same time) can feel very
                        inconvenient.
                    </li>

Capturing varying kinds of user behavior and thoughts as they interact with what may be otherwise seen as intuitive was eye-opening, and it's incredible to think about what the scale of work would be like to record personas for more complex designs.</h4>
